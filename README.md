# TorontoAI Events

This repository serves as the **canonical archive of TorontoAI events**, including demo nights, panels, pitch nights, workshops, and community meetups.

Each event is documented with a structured, developer-friendly recap that includes slide decks, recordings, demos, repositories, and relevant resources.

TorontoAI focuses on **applied AI**, platform engineering, and real-world deployments—not hype.
